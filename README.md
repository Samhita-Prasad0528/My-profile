## Hi, I’m Samhita 👋

I’m learning **ServiceNow development** by building and documenting **real-world ITSM projects**.

I believe that deeply understanding concepts and real-world problem solving is more valuable than just completing certifications.

This space is meant to learn, build, and grow together focusing on clarity, fundamentals, and practical ServiceNow usage rather than shortcuts.

Instead of only following tutorials, I focus on:
- Understanding *why* a solution is built
- Choosing the right ServiceNow feature for the problem
- Documenting projects clearly for learning and interview preparation

### What I’m working on
- Incident Management automations
- Service Catalog & approval flows
- Client Scripts & Business Rules
- Flow Designer–based workflows
- SLA, escalation, and CMDB-aware logic

### How this GitHub is organized
This GitHub contains:
- Beginner → intermediate → advanced ServiceNow projects
- Each project includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Design decisions
  - Scripts / flows
  - Screenshots
  - What I learned

### Tools & Concepts
- ServiceNow ITSM
- Client Scripts & UI Policies
- Business Rules & GlideRecord
- Flow Designer
- JavaScript (ServiceNow scripting)

📌 This repository is actively updated as I learn and build.
